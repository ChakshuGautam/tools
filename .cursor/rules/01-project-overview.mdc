  - [Package Files](mdc:src/commands/pkg/index.ts) - Concatenates files while respecting ignore patterns

## Project Structure

- Commands are defined in [src/commands/](mdc:src/commands) directory

- The base command class is defined in [src/commands/BaseCommand.ts](mdc:src/commands/BaseCommand.ts)
