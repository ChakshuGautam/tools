# Development Workflow

This project uses TypeScript with Bun as the runtime. Here's how to work with the codebase:

## Key Configuration Files

- [package.json](mdc:package.json) - Project dependencies and scripts
- [tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json) - TypeScript configuration

## Development Scripts

- `bun run build` - Builds the project using TypeScript
- `bun run start` - Runs the built application
- `bun run dev` - Runs TypeScript in watch mode for development
- `bun run test` - Runs tests with Bun's test runner

## Project Structure

- [src/](mdc:src) - Source code directory
- [dist/](mdc:dist) - Build output directory
- [src/types.ts](mdc:src/types.ts) - Common TypeScript interfaces and types

## Adding Features

1. To add a new command, create a directory under `src/commands/`
2. Implement the command following the command pattern in existing commands
3. Build the project with `bun run build`
4. Test your changes with `bun dist/index.js your-command`
